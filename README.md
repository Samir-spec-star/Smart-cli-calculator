# Smart CLI Calculator

The **Smart CLI Calculator** is a command-line application that allows users to perform various mathematical and unit conversion operations using natural language inputs. It is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, supporting a wide range of operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**:
  - Addition: `add 5 and 3`
  - Subtraction: `subtract 2 from 10`
  - Multiplication: `multiply 4 by 6`
  - Division: `divide 8 by 2`

- **Percentage Calculations**:
  - `what is 20% of 50`

- **Power and Roots**:
  - Square root: `square root of 16` or `sqrt of 16`
  - Power: `what is 2 to the power of 3`

- **Unit Conversions**:
  - Kilometers to miles: `convert 10 km to miles`
  - Kilograms to pounds: `convert 5 kg to pounds`
